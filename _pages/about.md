I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Mathematics at the Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Scientific Computing ([IMECC](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/)) from the [University of Campinas](https://unicamp.br/en/), under the supervision of [Marcos Jardim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vFnihs0AAAAJ) and [Cristian Martínez](https://sites.google.com/site/cristianmathinez/home). My interests lie in derived categories, Bridgeland stability conditions, moduli spaces of one-dimensional sheaves and quiver representations, among others. 

You can find my CV [here](https://dbernalm.github.io/files/CV - Daniel Bernal - Jan26.pdf).
